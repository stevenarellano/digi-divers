# Digi Divers

## About

"Digi Divers" is a gamified, peer-to-peer data annotation platform that leverages Solana smart contracts. It offers an efficient, cost-effective approach to data annotation by rewarding users for accurate annotations and penalizing incorrect ones. The platform utilizes technologies like SMS for accessibility, AWS for infrastructure, and programmable NFTs for rewards, targeting markets with lower incomes and high internet usage to provide income opportunities through data annotation.

This project won the University prize for $20,000 at the Solana Grizzlython, which was a hackathon comprised of over 10,000 participants.
